# Web_sever
In this repository, we simulate two hosts, a client and a server, where the server hosts a docker container in which it runs a web server, and the client hosts a docker container which inside runs a client that queries the web server. To run the script, first of all, we run the clean.sh file, which helps to clear the mininet network and also to clear the containers existing. Then finally, we build the docker images using the build-docker.sh file. Then when the images are built, we run the topology. As the topology runs, the client queries the web server to generate a web page, and the client queries the web server 10 times.
